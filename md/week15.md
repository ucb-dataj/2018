## Week 15 -- May 3

*Instructor: Amanda Hickman and Peter Aldhous*

This is your chance to show off your work this semester!

We present in the following, entirely random order.  I used the `RAND()` spreadsheet function to sort the class list, though I could also have used R or Postgres.

1. Reis
1. Charlotte
1. Saemmool
1. Carlos
1. Chloe
1. Susie
1. Simon
1. Tod
1. Josh
1. Nick
1. Sarah
1. Serena
1. Tien
1. James
1. Cat


In Postgres (or really almost any SQL based database) I could use:

```SQL
SELECT first_name FROM students ORDER BY RANDOM();
```

If you have a URL for your presentation, please add it under your name on the class document (this is currently only shared with your UCB email. If you need to access it from a different address, just request access and I'll approve you. )

[The Feedback Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mH9_a2jlgYdFoUEwNKs_mkdTSvV8ykbauZl_m_ITn_M/edit?usp=sharing)

Everyone should take some notes and identify ...

a) One thing that stood out to you about this project, and

b) At least one question you have for the presenter.
