## Data of the Week
Every week, one or two students will present a data set that they've identified as interesting to the rest of the class.

You'll have five minutes at the start of class to present your data findings. Plan to start by telling us something about an area you're interested in reporting on, and then identify a few agencies or organizations who are likely to collect and maintain relevant data or, identify one solid source for related data.

By Wednesday night, if it is your turn, you need to post one data set to bCourses. Your post should include:
+ A description of your reporting interest.
+ At least three agencies or organizations that might collect related data, or
+ a link to interesting related data / instructions for getting to the data (this should include enough information that someone else can follow your instructions and see the same numbers you're seeing.) If you're pointing to a specific URL, make sure you know who is behind that URL.
+ A description of the context of the data: who collected this data? Is it archival or living? How is it collected? (If you haven't identified a specific data set, you can walk through why you think each agency or organization would have relevant data.)

Note that by Week 4, we'll drop the option to point to potential data sources and expect you to actually identify a potentially usable data set.

### Alternate description
Data of the Week

Every week we want two or three students to present a data source that you're excited about working with. This can be something that is closely connected to your pitch, or something that you recently got interested in. You should submit a description of the data..

+ What is the data set?
+ Who maintains it, and how is it collected?
+ Why are you interested in this data? What was your path to it?

## Assignments

Exercise: file your code and the final result, to bCourses.


## Pitches

Your assignments this semester will be a mix of pitches and exercises. The phrase "pitch" will mean a lot of different things over the course of your career. In this class, this semester, a pitch should describe a story you're ready to write. And it should be based on data.

You're welcome to work on an issue area that overlaps with reporting you're doing for other courses, but this pitch should reflect a new angle on the story that is suitably distinct from reporting you are working on for other faculty.


**Preliminary Pitch:** Your preliminary pitch should clearly articulate the thought you've already put into this reporting idea. Note that the more thoughtful your preliminary pitch is, the more feedback and direction we can give you as you hone that pitch. At a minimum, your preliminary pitch must include the following:
  + a description of the area you're interested in exploring or reporting on
  + a news hook, or explanation of why this matters now
  + either ...
    a) a description of the data that's available and the agency or organization that maintains it (eg. "The St Louis Fed maintains a complete record of home mortgage lending figures, year over year." )
    b) or ideas about at least three agencies or organizations that should have relevant data (eg. "Student loan figures should be available from the Department of Education, Sallie Mae, or the Federal Reserve")

You are only required to submit one pitch, however you may submit up to three pitches. There's no extra-credit for submitting extra pitches, but if you're on the fence or trying to decide which is better suited to

**Revised Pitch:** Your revised pitch should reflect the feedback we gave you on your preliminary pitch as well as some further investigation on your part. Your revised pitch must include the following:
  + A working title/headline
  + A story slug -- up to three words that capture the essence of your story. Don't overthink this.
  + A description of at least three potential data sources. Your revised pitch should demonstrate that you've taken some meaningful steps to determine what data might be available, how you can acquire it, and what constraints there might be to it's usefulness.
  + At least three questions you already know you need to answer as you explore the viability of this pitch.

## Notes
Talk to Peter, but where do we want to put things like Geocoding tip sheets? Wiki? Or in a class page?

A: We can do it on these pages.
I have a geocoder here: https://github.com/paldhous/refine-geocoder

Do we want to bring in speakers? Who are good speakers to bring in?
That's an option for the TBD class, maybe. I invite Ben Welsh for my Santa Cruz class. Somebody with his enthusiasm would be great. If Lam was in town she'd be good for social data.
