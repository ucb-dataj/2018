## Weekly Notes

## Data of the Week
Every week, one or two students should present a data set that they've identified as interesting (so that everyone goes at least once). It can be a data set you saw someone else reporting on and tracked down, or it can be one that you thing might be fertile ground for new reporting.

By Wednesday night, if it is your turn, you need to post one data set to the class blog. Your post should include:
+ A link to the data, or instructions for getting to the data.
+ A description of the context of the data: who collected this data? Is it archival or living? What is the context of the collection?
+ Why is this interesting?

*Question* Where do we want them to post these?


## Pitches
(Frequent Assignment) your assignments this semester will be a mix of pitches and exercises. The phrase "pitch" will mean a lot of different things over the course of your career. In this class, this semester, a pitch should describe a story you're ready to write. And it should be based on data.




## Notes
Talk to Peter, but where do we want to put things like Geocoding tip sheets? Wiki? Or in a class page?

Do we want to bring in speakers? Who are good speakers to bring in?
