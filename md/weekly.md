## Weekly Notes


## Data of the Week
Every week, one or two students should present a data set that they've identified as interesting (so that everyone goes at least once).

Start by telling us something about an area you're interested in reporting on, and then identify a few agencies or organizations who are likely to collect and maintain relevant data.

By Wednesday night, if it is your turn, you need to post one data set to the class blog. Your post should include:
+ A description of your reporting interest.
+ At least three agencies or organizations that might collect related data.
+ A link to the data, or instructions for getting to the data.
+ A description of the context of the data: who collected this data? Is it archival or living? What is the context of the collection?

They should be posted to bCourses.


## Pitches


Exercise: file your code and the final result.
(Frequent Assignment) your assignments this semester will be a mix of pitches and exercises. The phrase "pitch" will mean a lot of different things over the course of your career. In this class, this semester, a pitch should describe a story you're ready to write. And it should be based on data.




## Notes
Talk to Peter, but where do we want to put things like Geocoding tip sheets? Wiki? Or in a class page?

A: We can do it on these pages.
I have a geocoder here: https://github.com/paldhous/refine-geocoder

Do we want to bring in speakers? Who are good speakers to bring in?
That's an option for the TBD class, maybe. I invite Ben Welsh for my Santa Cruz class. Somebody with his enthusiasm would be great. If Lam was in town she'd be good for social data.
