This will not be an excercise in copying and pasting code. Instead, you will work in small groups to answer questions from the data, in two stages.</p><p><strong>1)</strong> In plain English, work out the sequence of steps to achieve the desired result, using our basic operations with data:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>Sort:</strong> Largest to smallest, oldest to newest, alphabetical etc.</p>
</li><li><p><strong>Filter:</strong> Select a defined subset of the data.</p>
</li><li><p><strong>Summarize/Aggregate:</strong> Deriving one value from a series of other values to produce a summary statistic. Examples include: count, sum, mean, median, maximum, minimum etc. Often you’ll <strong>group</strong> data into categories first, and then aggregate by group.</p>
</li><li><p><strong>Join:</strong> Merging entries from two or more datasets based on common field(s), e.g. unique ID number, last name and first name.</p>
</li></ul><p><strong>2)</strong> Convert those steps into <strong>dplyr</strong> code.</p><h3 id="the-data-we-will-use-today"><a name="the-data-we-will-use-today" href="#the-data-we-will-use-today"></a>The data we will use today</h3><p>Download the data for this session from <a href="data/week12.zip">here</a>, unzip the folder and place it on your desktop. It contains the following files, used in reporting <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18806-revealed-pfizers-payments-to-censured-doctors/">this story</a>, which revealed that some of the doctors paid as “experts” by the drug company Pfizer had troubling disciplinary records:</p><ul>
<li><p><code>pfizer.csv</code> Payments made by Pfizer to doctors across the United States in the second half on 2009. Contains the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>org_indiv</code> Full name of the doctor, or their organization.</li><li><code>first_plus</code> Doctor’s first and middle names.</li><li><code>first_name</code> <code>last_name</code>. First and last names.</li><li><code>city</code> <code>state</code> City and state.</li><li><code>category of payment</code> Type of payment, which include <code>Expert-led Forums</code>, in which doctors lecture their peers on using Pfizer’s drugs, and `Professional Advising.</li><li><code>cash</code> Value of payments made in cash.</li><li><code>other</code> Value of payments made in-kind, for example puschase of meals.</li><li><code>total</code> value of payment, whether cash or in-kind.</li></ul>
</li><li><p><code>fda.csv</code> Data on warning letters sent to doctors by the US Food and Drug Administration, because of problems in the way in which they ran clinical trials testing experimental treatments. Contains the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>name_last</code> <code>name_first</code> <code>name_middle</code> Doctor’s last, first, and middle names.</li><li><code>issued</code> Date letter was sent.</li><li><code>office</code> Office within the FDA that sent the letter.</li></ul>
</li></ul><h3 id="setting-up"><a name="setting-up" href="#setting-up"></a>Setting up</h3><p>As before, save your R script to the folder with your data, then set the working directory to this folder by selecting from the top menu <code>Session&gt;Set Working Directory&gt;To Source File Location</code>.
