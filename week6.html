That means it can <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/danvergano/fentanyl-leading-overdoses">easily cause fatal overdoses</a> — although these mostly happen from illegaly purchased fentanyl.</p><p>From the final part of the assignment from last week, you should have seen that there are three variants of fentanyl in the <code>generic_name</code> data: <code>FENTANYL</code>, <code>FENTANYL CITRATE</code> and <code>FENTANYL CITRATE/PF</code>. So if we are to answer this question, we need to filter the data to include all of these drugs, and then add up the prescriptions for each doctor.</p><p>This is one way to do this:</p><pre class="r hljs"><code class="r" data-origin="<pre><code class=&quot;r&quot;># who wrote the most prescriptions for fentanyl in 2015?

Notice how the <code>OR</code> part of the filter, using <code>|</code>, is put into parentheses to run it first.</p><p>After the filter, we need to group by doctor, before summarizing the data. The unique identifying code for each healthcare provider is their National Provider Identifier, or <code>npi</code>. However, if we only group by this, the data returned won’t include any other information about each doctor. So the code above also groups by doctors’ names, locations, and specialties, so the data returned contains more information. This won’t change the grouping, because we are still grouping by individual healthcare provider.</p><p>In the <code>summarize</code> function, we need to add the numbers for <code>total_claim_count</code> for each provider, using the function <code>sum</code>, to get the total number of prescriptions written by each one for all the variants of fentanyl.</p><p>Here is another, more concise way to obtain the same result:</p><pre class="r hljs"><code class="r" data-origin="<pre><code class=&quot;r&quot;># who wrote the most prescriptions for fentanyl in 2015?

Then we <strong>group</strong> by doctor, returning the same identifying information as in earlier examples, before <strong>summarizing</strong> by adding the number of prescriptions written, and the total cost of the drugs, across the entire three-year time period in the data. Then we use <code>mutate</code> to create a new column giving the cost per prescription for each doctor.

Particularly useful are histograms, to examine a distribution, and scatterplots, to see how one variable varies with another.</p><p>To make simple charts, we will use <strong>ggplot2</strong>.</p><h4 id="introducing-ggplot2-and-the-grammar-of-graphics"><a name="introducing-ggplot2-and-the-grammar-of-graphics" href="#introducing-ggplot2-and-the-grammar-of-graphics"></a>Introducing ggplot2 and the grammar of graphics</h4><p>The “gg” in <strong>ggplot2</strong> stands for “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448">grammar of graphics</a>,” an approach to drawing charts devised by the statistician Leland Wilkinson. Rather than thinking in terms of finished charts like a scatter plot or a column chart, it starts by defining the coordinate system (usually the X and Y axes), maps data onto those coordinates, and then adds layers such as points, bars and so on. This is the logic behind ggplot2 code.</p><p>Some key things to understand about <strong>ggplot2</strong>:</p><ul>
<li><code>ggplot</code> This is the master function that creates a <strong>ggplot2</strong> chart.</li><li><code>aes</code> This function, named for “aesthetic mapping,” is used whenever data values are mapped onto a chart. So it is used when you define which variables are plotted onto the X and Y axes, and also if you want to change the size or color of parts of the chart according to values for a variable.</li><li><code>geom</code> All of the functions that add layers to a chart start with <code>geom</code>, followed by an underscore, for example <code>geom_point</code> or <code>geom_bar</code>. The code in the parentheses for any <code>geom</code> layer styles the items in that layer, and can include <code>aes</code> mappings of values from data.</li><li><code>theme</code> This function modifies the appearance of elements of a plot, used, for example, to set size and font face for text, the position of a legend, and so on.</li><li><code>scale</code> Functions that begin with <code>scale</code>, followed by an underscore, are used to modify the way an <code>aes</code> mapping of data appears on a chart. They can change the axis range, for example, or specify a color palette to be used to encode values in the data.</li><li><code>+</code> is used each time you add a layer, a scale, a theme, or elements like axis labels and a title. After a <code>+</code> you can continue on the same line of code or move the next line. I usually write a new line after each <code>+</code>, which makes the code easier to follow.</li></ul><h4 id="make-a-histogram-of-the-prescriptions-data"><a name="make-a-histogram-of-the-prescriptions-data" href="#make-a-histogram-of-the-prescriptions-data"></a>Make a histogram of the prescriptions data</h4><pre class="r hljs"><code class="R" data-origin="<pre><code class=&quot;R&quot;># histogram of the costs data
