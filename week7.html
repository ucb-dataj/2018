One result is that accidental gun deaths are wildly under counted.</p>

    <li><p><strong>The Fires (Joe Flood)</strong> -- The Fires is one of a few excellent stories about the famous burning Bronx of the 1970s. One thing he talks about, which others have also talked about, is the direct relationship between radical cutbacks in FDNY station funding in the Bronx and the rise in fires -- maybe The Bronx was burning because the infrastructure to put fires out had been decimated. RAND's statistical team analyzed <em>precicted</em> citywide response times and determined that the city could safely close a lot of Bronx firehouses -- without acknowledging that those firehouses were some of the busiest in the city and often weren't responding to fires in their immediate vicinity because they were already out fighting fires. So a very "pure" data-driven approach conveniently rationalized shuttering a lot of stations in poor areas.</p>

    <li><p>This is a classic in statistics texts: in the 70s, researchers looked at admissions rates at UC Berkeley and found that women were far, far more likely to be rejected. A closer examination revealed that women were more likely to apply to more competitive programs, so department by department, there wasn’t evidence of discrimination. <a href="http://vudlab.com/simpsons/">http://vudlab.com/simpsons/</a> --</p>

    <p>This is closely related to the ecological fallacy: if I tell you that states with more foreign born residents have more wealthy households, what’s your next question? (Are foreign born people more likely to be wealthy? No.) An older study showed that there was a positive state-by-state correlation between literacy and foreign born populations: areas with high immigrant populations were likely to be more literate. What you don’t know is whether immigrants are likely to be more literate.</p>

    <p>Question order changes how people respond to questions. This is over a decade old now, but in '03, Americans were more likely to say they support civil unions if you already asked them if they support gay marriage.</p>
