<p>This course is for students who want to make finding and reporting stories from data part of their toolkit. It will be useful for anyone interested in investigative journalism, which nowadays is often heavily data-driven, or those keen to use data to provide context and ground-truth for regular beat reporting. You should be comfortable with numbers, and thinking critically and quantitatively. You must be prepared to work with some simple code (in R and SQL), and to get your hands dirty with real-life, messy data!</p>
<h3 id="weekly-schedule"><a name="weekly-schedule" href="#weekly-schedule"></a>Weekly schedule</h3>
<p>We will meet in <strong>108/Lower NG</strong> on Thursdays from 6pm - 9pm. Your instructors, <a href="http://www.peteraldhous.com/"><strong>Peter Aldhous</strong></a> and <strong><a href="http://velociraptor.info/">Amanda Hickman</a></strong>, will maintain office hours over Skype. You are encouraged to arrange appointments to discuss your work.</p>

<p>Unexcused absence from two classes will drop you one letter grade; a third unexcused absence will result in an F. Excused absences will be permitted only in extraordinary circumstances. Regardless of the reason for an absence, students will be responsible for any assignments due and for learning material covered in class.</p>

<h3 id="academic-dishonesty-and-plagiarism"><a name="academic-dishonesty-and-plagiarism" href="#academic-dishonesty-and-plagiarism"></a>Academic dishonesty and plagiarism</h3>
<p>The high academic standard at the University of California, Berkeley, is reflected in each degree that is awarded. As a result, it is up to every student to maintain this high standard by ensuring that all academic work reflects his/her own ideas or properly attributes the ideas to the original sources.</p>
<p>These are some basic expectations of students with regards to academic integrity:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Any work submitted should be your own individual thoughts, and should not have been submitted for credit in another course unless you have prior written permission to re-use it in this course from this instructor.</p>
</li><li><p>All assignments must use “proper attribution,” meaning that you have identified the original source of words or ideas that you reproduce or use in your assignment. This includes drafts and homework assignments!</p>
</li><li><p>If you are unclear about expectations, ask your instructor.</p>
</li></ul>
<h3 id="disability-accommodations"><a name="disability-accommodations" href="#disability-accommodations"></a>Disability accommodations</h3>
<p>If you need disability-related accommodations in this class, if you have emergency medical information you wish to share with the instructor, or if you need special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please inform the instructors as soon as possible by seeing one of us after class or making an appointment to visit during office hours. If you are not currently listed with DSP (Disabled Students’ Program) but believe that you could benefit from their support, we encourage you to <a href="http://dsp.berkeley.edu/">apply online</a>.</p>
