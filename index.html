        <h1 id="sql-what-was-tricky-">SQL: What was tricky?</h1>
        <p>We're going to spend the next three weeks on SQL and mapping. I want to look at where folks got stuck and how to get unstuck.</p>
        <p>Charlotte had a fun one this week, and I want to walk through some of my troubleshooting:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>I didn't tell you what the redirect operator <code>&gt;</code> does. Did anyone try it? What does it do?</li>
        <li>Some of you tried running that in Postico, instead of in the Terminal. What's the difference?</li>
        <li>Some of you tried to run "snippet.csv" -- why wouldn't that work?</li>
        <li>Here's an example of a question that I immediately knew the answer to. What does that Error mean?:</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="editor-colors lang-line"><div class="line"><span class="syntax--text syntax--plain syntax--null-grammar"><span>I&nbsp;tried&nbsp;loading&nbsp;the&nbsp;three&nbsp;datasets&nbsp;I&nbsp;have&nbsp;from&nbsp;AHS&nbsp;into&nbsp;Postico&nbsp;just&nbsp;to&nbsp;view&nbsp;the&nbsp;tables&nbsp;and&nbsp;I&nbsp;got:</span></span></div></pre><ul>
        <li>Which one is the Postgres table? Which is the csv file?</li>
        <li><p>And then we encountered a new error. What clues do you see in this error? I had to look at the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/sql-copy.html">Posgres COPY</a> documentation to resolve it.</p>
        <p>  ERROR:  invalid input syntax for integer: "'11000001'"
          CONTEXT:  COPY household_snip, line 2, column CONTROL: "'11000001'"</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>If you're curious, here's a data sample:</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="editor-colors lang-line"><div class="line"><span class="syntax--text syntax--plain syntax--null-grammar"><span>CONTROL,TOTROOMS,TOTHCAMT,PERPOVLVL,JACPRIMARY,JACSECNDRY,JADEQUACY,JARTACCESS,JARTATTRACT,JARTAWARE,JARTECON,</span></span></div></pre>
        <ul>
        <li>Josh had a question about <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/functions-formatting.html">number formats</a>. Go ahead and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qyVKQkpmJ1Tj4A0_He2rU_E1blcLkELg/view">grab his data</a>, create a table for it, and import the data into the table.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="editor-colors lang-line"><div class="line"><span class="syntax--text syntax--plain syntax--null-grammar"><span>CREATE&nbsp;TABLE&nbsp;forfeiture&nbsp;(</span></span></div></pre>
        <p>The second problem is super quirky. The short version is <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/datatype-numeric.html">math is hard</a> even for computers. And honestly I'm a little embarrassed that I've just never bothered to dig into this, so the best I can do is wave my hands around and mumble about how computers store numeric data and optimization. In fairness to myself the Postgres manual isn't a lot more specific:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Inexact means that some values cannot be converted exactly to the internal format and are stored as approximations, so that storing and retrieving a value might show slight discrepancies. Managing these errors and how they propagate through calculations is the subject of an entire branch of mathematics and computer science and will not be discussed here</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>What I can tell you is what your options are for solving the problem.</p>
        <p>There are a few different options. You can use <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/functions-formatting.html">formatting</a> to customize the number, you can <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/typeconv-func.html">round it off</a> or, you cast as <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/datatype-money.html">money</a>.</p>
        <pre class="editor-colors lang-line"><div class="line"><span class="syntax--text syntax--plain syntax--null-grammar"><span>SELECT&nbsp;county,&nbsp;year,&nbsp;SUM(amount_forfeit::numeric)</span></span></div></pre>
        <p>I have a bigger question though: should we be taking the sum of all <code>amount_forfeit</code> to begin with? Try these two queries and let's discuss.</p>
        <pre class="editor-colors lang-line"><div class="line"><span class="syntax--text syntax--plain syntax--null-grammar"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></div></pre>
        <h1 id="digging-into-mapping">Digging into Mapping</h1>
        <p>Cartography and GIS aren't the same thing. We're talking about very basic maps as visualizations here. <a href="http://maptime.io/lessons-resources/">More on that</a></p>
        <h2 id="shapes-points-lines">Shapes, Points, Lines</h2>
        <h3 id="mapping-points">Mapping Points</h3>
        <p>"Geocoding" refers to the process of identifying an individual latitude/longitude pair for an address or other location description. To actually plot a location on a map, you need the location's latitude and longitude. <code>219 West 40th Street</code> means nothing without coordinates.</p>
        <p>Geocoding is actually challenging because there aren't good, free resources for doing batch jobs, where many addresses are geocoded at once. My <a href="https://github.com/amandabee/cunyjdata/wiki/Tip-Sheet:-Geocoding">Geocoding Tip Sheet</a> includes some helpful resources, but many city data sources actually include coordinates, so double check that, first.</p>
        <p>If you're committed to mapping points, you may need my help geocoding them.</p>
        <h3 id="mapping-lines">Mapping Lines</h3>
        <p>No student has ever pitched me a compelling map that features lines rather than shapes or points. I did a project that drew out flight maps showing how far from home every prisoner incarcerated in Florence, CO is, but I pitched that, so it doesn't count. To draw that map I had to take a <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2011/05/11/how-to-map-connections-with-great-circles/">crash course</a> in rendering lines. If you're excited about doing something like this, great! But you're going to need to install R and walk through Nathan Yau's tutorial before you do anything else.</p>
        <h3 id="mapping-polygons">Mapping Polygons</h3>
        <p>Zipcodes, council districts, police precincts -- these are all polygons. Most of your maps will be in polygons. These polygons are defined in (usually) one of two specialized file formats -- a "Shapefile" or a "KML" file. The syntax of the file types varies, but they contain basically the same information -- the polygon called "Bronx CB 04" is defined by this series of lat/lon pairs. My <a href="https://github.com/amandabee/cunyjdata/wiki/Where-to-Find-Shapefiles">Shapefiles Tip Sheet</a> has some excellent resources for finding shapefiles though a lot of the resources there are New York City specific.</p>
        <p>Often (usually) your data won't include a shapefile. If you have High School graduation rates by school districts, and you want to map those, you need to find a shapefile that describes the outline of each school district, and then you need to combine that shapefile with your data, by identifying a column that the two tables have in common.</p>
        <h2 id="projections">Projections</h2>
        <p>We don't deal with <a href="http://xkcd.com/977/">projections</a> much but they matter. And if you have inconsistent projections you might end up with a map where the city of <a href="https://amandabee.carto.com/viz/d42d245a-5aa2-11e5-ba80-0e853d047bba/public_map">San Francisco is floating about 10 miles NE of where it belongs</a>.  I had to <a href="https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/162779/why-is-the-city-of-san-francsico-floating-over-point-richmond">ask for help</a> to resolve that.</p>
        <p>Most of the time you're going to be in WGS84.</p>
        <p>The Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator">web mercator</a> is pretty good if you're dying to understand how this all fits together, but EPSG is an obsolete acronym for European Petroleum Survey Group a scientific research group with ties to the petroleum industry. They compiled a comprehensive database of projections and coordinate systems.  </p>
        <h2 id="vectors-and-rasters">Vectors and Rasters</h2>
        <p>We can head down some serious rabbit holes here. But it is worth understanding the distinction between a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics">vector</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics">raster</a>, because they'll come up again and again in all kinds of contexts.</p>
        <h2 id="shapefiles">Shapefiles</h2>
        <p>What is a shapefile? There are a few different widely used formats for storing geographic information. ESRI makes ArcGIS which is popular and expensive. Their shapefile format is almost universal. Google Maps uses it's own KML format.</p>
        <h2 id="asking-for-help">Asking for help</h2>
        <p>I can't say enough about the importance of learning how to ask for help. If you look at my <a href="https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/24497/amanda?tab=questions&amp;sort=newest">gis.stackexchange.com</a> profile you can see where I got stuck and then unstuck, starting back in 2013. There's a community there that is very good about <a href="https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/84443/what-is-this-postgis-query-doing-to-show-great-circle-connections">thoroughly explaining</a> what you're dealing with.</p>
        <h1 id="open-qgis">Open QGIS</h1>
        <p>Okay, so let's actually do some mapping.</p>
        <p>In 2011, the BLS published a <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-2/death-on-the-job-fatal-work-injuries-in-2011.htm">map of fatal workplace injuries</a> by state.</p>
        <p>What do we think of this map?</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Are these colors continuous or categorical? Should they be? Is anyone surprised that CA and TX have a lot of workplace injuries? How can we improve on this?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So we'll recreate it:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="data/week9/">BLS Fatality Data</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/totals/2011/tables/NST-EST2011-01.csv">2011 Population Estimates</a> (via <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/data/historical/2010s/vintage_2011/state.html">census.gov</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I already combined the Census 2011 population estimates with the BLS workplace fatality data. We're actually going to use Postgres to do the first piece of this -- we could do it just as easily in <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/">a spreadsheet</a> but we need the SQL practice.</p>
        <pre class="editor-colors lang-line"><div class="line"><span class="syntax--text syntax--plain syntax--null-grammar"><span>CREATE&nbsp;TABLE&nbsp;bls_fatalities_2011&nbsp;(</span></span></div></pre>
        <p>Do you remember how to load data into a table?</p>
        <p>And how are we going to normalize this?</p>
        <pre class="editor-colors lang-line"><div class="line"><span class="syntax--text syntax--plain syntax--null-grammar"><span>ALTER&nbsp;TABLE&nbsp;bls_fatalities_2011&nbsp;ADD&nbsp;COLUMN&nbsp;fatality_rate&nbsp;float;</span></span></div></pre>
        <p>And then try out a query to fill that rate column:</p>
        <pre class="editor-colors lang-line"><div class="line"><span class="syntax--text syntax--plain syntax--null-grammar"><span>SELECT&nbsp;,</span></span></div></pre>
        <p>And then actually do it:</p>
        <pre class="editor-colors lang-line"><div class="line"><span class="syntax--text syntax--plain syntax--null-grammar"><span>UPDATE&nbsp;bls_fatalities_2011&nbsp;SET&nbsp;fatality_rate&nbsp;=&nbsp;((fatalities::float/population)100000);</span></span></div></pre>
        <p>Why did we have to re-cast it? Well, <a href="https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/200320/what-am-i-doing-wrong-with-my-math">because</a>.
        And then output it:</p>
        <pre class="editor-colors lang-line"><div class="line"><span class="syntax--text syntax--plain syntax--null-grammar"><span>COPY&nbsp;bls_fatalities_2011&nbsp;TO&nbsp;'~/Desktop/bls_normalized.csv'&nbsp;DELIMITER&nbsp;','&nbsp;CSV&nbsp;HEADER;</span></span></div></pre>
        <h3 id="adding-a-shapefile">Adding a shapefile</h3>
        <p>To actually map this, we need some states. Who keeps track of US State boundaries? <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger.html">The Census</a>. You want "Cartographic Boundary Shapefiles" &gt; "States". The state boundaries don't actually change, so it doesnt matter which year.</p>
        <p>For our purposes 1:20,000,000 is plenty of resolution.</p>
        <p>You should be able to load the zip file in as a layer.</p>
        <p>Why does it look all squished? Once upon a time <a href="https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/167181/why-would-an-svg-output-from-cartodb-look-squished-when-the-map-doesnt">I asked about that</a>, too. The answer is kind of cool. If we use the toggle on the bottom right to switch to "EPSG 54004" we get something that looks a little more familiar.  </p>
        <h3 id="loading-a-basemap">Loading a basemap</h3>
        <p>You need a basemap. The "tile map scale plugin" -- does a nice job of automatically zooming you to an available tile layer, which the other base map plugins don't do.</p>
        <p>So go ahead and download the plugin. <code>Plugins &gt; Manage and Install Plugins ...</code>  and search for "Tile Map Scale"</p>
        <p><img src="/home/amanda/Public/2018/home/amanda/Public/2018/md/img/week9_01.png" alt="adding a layer"></p>
        <p>That will give you a tiny pulldown on the map that lets you add a base layer so you can see where you are in the world.</p>
        <h3 id="qgis-built-in-join">QGIS Built In Join</h3>
        <p>Add your CSV to QGIS (it has no geometry.)</p>
        <p>Look at the Attribute table for the Shapefile. How are we going to join this?</p>
        <p>And then style it.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Use equal intervals. <a href="https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/84562/am-i-misunderstanding-equal-interval">I found a bug once</a> which is another reason to ask for help. They had no idea.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Make compound labels with the <code>||</code> operator.</p>
        <p>NAME  || '\n' || "bls_fatalities_2011_Workplace Fatalities 2011"</p>
        </li>

        <p>If you need to transform addresses into lat/lon pairs, you have a couple of options:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Fusion Tables will do it, but their terms of service say you have to use that data on a Google Map.</li>
        <li>Geocoder.us Will do one address at a time, or you can pay for a batch</li>
        <li>CartoDB gives you a bunch free and you can pay for more.</li>

        <p>We probably won't get to this. And this week all we're going to do is talk it through. We're not going to tackle it.</p>
        <p>In 2006, California voters passed <a href="http://www.lao.ca.gov/ballot/2006/83_11_2006.htm">Prop 83</a>, which requires registered sex offenders to live at least 2000 feet from any school or playground. In 2015, the state supreme court said the <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/California-Loosens-Sex-Offender-Residency-Restrictions-297740931.html">blanket restriction was too broad</a> and the law could only be applied to offenders whose crimes involved children.</p>
        <p>Sex offender restrictions buffered around schools to show how much of a city is off limits.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Walk through how we would do it, in theory. What do we need?</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="editor-colors lang-line"><div class="line"><span class="syntax--text syntax--plain syntax--null-grammar"><span>+&nbsp;location&nbsp;of&nbsp;every&nbsp;public&nbsp;school&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;county</span></span></div></pre><p>Alameda publishes at least the schools: <a href="https://data.acgov.org/Education/Alameda-County-Schools/yza6-6jwu">https://data.acgov.org/Education/Alameda-County-Schools/yza6-6jwu</a></p>
        <p>Then we're going to need a way to calculate circles around those points. I want you to take five minutes to think of a Google search that might let you get at that. Put your search terms in the Etherpad.</p>

        <p>More applications of this? If you aren't following SB 827 you should be. So how would you map the impact of that bill? <a href="https://transitrichhousing.org/">https://transitrichhousing.org/</a> tried.</p>
